## Hi there 👋

I'm Matt, a contract full stack developer with a decade of experience living in Suffolk, UK. I have a son 👦 2 cats :cat: :cat2: and a dog 🐕. He/him please.

I focus on writing great TypeScript that won't be a nightmare for people in a few years time. 

I'm currently looking for my next contract after modernising a legacy rail infrastructure app :metal: if you need someone whose bread and butter is web applications then contact me.

You can visit my website at <a href="https://www.m11r.dev" target="_blank">www.m11r.dev</a>. If you're looking for more then search for `matt123miller` on the interwebs and I'll show up on every platform.
