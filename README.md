## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt, a full stack web developer living in Suffolk, UK. I have 2 cats :cat: :cat2:. He/him please.

I focus on writing great JavaScript that won't be a nightmare for people in a few years time. 

I currently work for [Pebble Beach](https://www.pebble.tv/) helping them expand their web software offerings :metal:.

You can visit my website at [www.m11r.dev](https://www.m11r.dev). If you're looking for more then search for `matt123miller` on the interwebs and I'll show up on every platform.
